Static Site Builder. For instructions, see the file StaticSiteBuilder.pdf.

Principal features:

* You can create a website with multiple pages connected with a menu without any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. But if you want to use HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, you can do so without restriction.
* Markdown is built-in.
* Masonry (a grid layout system) is built-in (masonry.desandro.com).
* Sites are responsive, so the they work on large screens or small ones (e.g., phones).
* Created pages automatically are added to the site-wide menu, in a sidebar or, on small screens, as a hamburger menu.
* Page headers, footers, menus, and CSS are automatically included, and you can control their contents if you want.
* Pages can be edited inside the application, or with an external editor.
